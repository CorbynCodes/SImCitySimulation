The purpose of this file is to describe in detail the Godzilla functions (i.e. move).

# OVERVIEW:

The Godzilla class is responsible for managing the movement of Godzilla within the city. It is responsible for moving Godzilla to a new location, checking if the new location is valid, and updating the map with Godzilla's new position.

# File Management:

'Godzilla.cpp' has the implementation of the "Godzilla" class methods. It contains the logic for moving Godzilla. This file is critical as it houses the core logic that defines how Godzilla interacts with the city environment through movements.

## Functions:

**move**

- The documentation details the "move" function, which is a method within the Godzilla class. This function is responsible for updating Godzilla's position on the map. It includes checks to validate the new position, ensuring it is a legitimate move within the context of the city's layout and possibly other game mechanics (not detailed in the snippet).

## Purpose of Documenation

The primary purpose of this documentation is to provide developers or users of the code with a clear understanding of how Godzilla is manipulated within the simulation. It serves as a guide for understanding the responsibilities of the Godzilla class and its impact on the game or simulation environment, ensuring that anyone working with or extending the code has a solid foundation of its core functionality.
